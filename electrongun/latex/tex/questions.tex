\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item how many particles are necessary in total?
  \item what is a good macro charge to number of particles ratio?
  \item do we need to emit particles over time? if so, how many bunches should we emit and how large is the timing spread between bunches and inside a single bunch?
  \item should we emit particles uniformly or normally along the entire cathode?
  \item can we validate the space charge effects by looking at the particle trajectories (or other data)?
\end{itemize}
