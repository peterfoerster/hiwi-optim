\section{Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item cost function uses outermost beam minimum, distance of beam minima and radial derivatives of minima
  \item extra constraint to force continuity at (0,0)
  \item start with straight cathode
  \item only load the geometry once and manipulate control points (increase number of control points with each optimization cycle)
\end{itemize}
