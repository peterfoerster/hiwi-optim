\section{Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item cost function uses outermost beam minimum, distance of beam minima and radial derivatives of minima
  \item extra constraint to force continuity at (0,0)
  \item start with straight cathode
  \item how to correctly manipulate control points to only load the geometry once (increase number of control points with each optimization cycle)
\end{itemize}
