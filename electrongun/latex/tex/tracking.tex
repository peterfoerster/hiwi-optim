\section{Tracking}
\begin{itemize}
  \item new implementation for fieldmap computation: hand over $\Delta_{x,y,z}$ and compute $h$ as the diagonal of the cuboid
  \item choose $N_{x,y,z}$ such that the desired domain is fully enclosed
  \item repeat convergence study by simultaneously decreasing $\Delta$ by $2^{-n}$

  \item do this for full 3D fieldmap right away (only compute one quadrant and take care of the duplicate entries at the interfaces)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item emission is handled on my side, either uniformly or normally distributed particles
  \item both types depend on multiple parameters: total charge $Q$, number of particles $N_{prt}$, position of probe particles and also bounds for uniform or $\mu, \sigma$ for normal distribution
\end{itemize}
