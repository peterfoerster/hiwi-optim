# hiwi-optim

- insulator inner radius: 25
- insulator outer radius: 35
- insulator epsilon: 9.4

- different epsilon should be integrated fairly easily in op_gradu_gradv_mp 
- either hardcode or make coeff a function that depends on the patches indices
- does not seem to work properly, check with the larger geometry
