% Curve is degree-n_mult (number of knot repetitions) times differentiable in any point.

% Perform knot insertion to achieve multiplicity equal to order for each knot. This does not change the shape of ...
% the curve, however it makes the NURBS only C^0 (interpolatory) in the knots which allows for the cutting into ...
% separate disjoint NURBS that each have the same order and maintain the same shape (and same continuity at the interfaces).

% Use a smooth NURBS (arbitrary order) to start. Then insert knots at predetermined positions to split into the individual curves.
% Increase the degree of the entire NURBS to investigate convergence.
% Insert knots (only increase number of knots or also multiplicity?), each knot adds a control point.
